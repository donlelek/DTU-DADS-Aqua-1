### DTU-DADS-Aqua: A simulation framework for aquatic epidemiology

*Price, D., Mardones, F., Gardner, I., Romero, J., Halasa, T.*

The DTU-DADS-Aqua framework is an adaptation of the DTU-DADS model used by Halasa et al. (2015) to simulate the spread of African Swine Fever in Denmark. The Davis Animal Disease Simulation Model (DADS) is a spatially-explicit hybrid simulation framework and was first used by Bates et al. (2003) to model the effect of vaccination and preemptive culling for eradicating FMD in California. Since then, the model was further improved to account more complex scenarios such as sporadical contact with feral animals (Halasa et al. 2017)

We have adapted this framework to simulate the spread of Infectious
Salmon Anemia Virus (ISAV) in salmon farms located in the Bay of Fundy, New Brunswick, Canada. Our simulation model includes the dissemination of ISAV at three different levels: within a cage (deterministic), between cages (stochastic), and between farms (stochastic).

For the within cage transmission, we have chosen a Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Removed (SEIR) model.

Although this model seem to be an oversimplification of the dynamics of ISA infection, it describes the spread of disease in a population accurately, and allow easy exploration of *what-if* scenarios.
